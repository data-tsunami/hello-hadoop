Hello World Hadoop project... Eclipse + Maven + unit tests

# Project files & dirs

- _/conf_: config to be used for running MR on the cluster
- _/conf-local_: config to be used for running MR locally
- _/hadoop-1.2.0_: Hadoop binaries (recomended WITHOUT conf/ dir, to avoid mistakes)

To setup files on /conf directory, you can use `core-site.xml.sample` and `mapred-site.xml.sample` as reference.

# Before running

Before running the MR jobs you need to build the JAR and generate some data.

### Build the jar

	$ mvn clean package

### Generate sample data

	$ find /usr/share/doc > /tmp/MYDATA.txt

# Run the MR job locally using Ant

From Eclipse, run the `launch-local.xml` as an Ant script. By default the task `launch-local` is used, which does _not_ clean the output directory. You can use the `clean-and-launch` task to clean the output directory before the launch of the MR job.

# Run the MR job locally from CLI

### Run locally

	$ ./hadoop-1.2.0/bin/hadoop --config conf-local jar hello-hadoop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
		ar.com.datatsunami.hellohadoop.Launcher file:///tmp/MYDATA.txt file:///tmp/OUTPUT

# Run the MR job in the cluster

### Build the jar

	$ mvn clean package

### Copy the data to HDFS

	$ ./hadoop-1.2.0/bin/hadoop --config conf fs -copyFromLocal /tmp/MYDATA.txt /

### Launch!

	$ ./hadoop-1.2.0/bin/hadoop --config conf jar hello-hadoop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar \
		ar.com.datatsunami.hellohadoop.Launcher /MYDATA.txt /OUTPUT

### See the output directory:

	$ ./hadoop-1.2.0/bin/hadoop --config conf fs -ls /OUTPUT

# Some Maven recipes

### Setup Eclipse classpath using Maven

    $ mvn eclipse:eclipse

### Hadoop sources for use in Eclipse (doesn't works)

To download the Hadoop sources or javadocs DOESN'T WORKS with Maven, so you'll have to setup in Eclipse by yourself.

	$ mvn dependency:sources -DincludeGroupIds=org.apache.hadoop 
	(...)

	[INFO]    org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-core:java-source:sources:1.2.0

	(...)

	$ mvn dependency:resolve -DincludeGroupIds=org.apache.hadoop -Dclassifier=javadoc 
	(...)
	[INFO] The following files have NOT been resolved:
